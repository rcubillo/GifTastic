### About
    • I'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of my choice. 
    I called the GIPHY API and I used JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.
  
### Instructions 
    • When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
    • When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
    • Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
    • There is a form takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your `topics` array

### How-to use this code
    You will need to open the index.html in your browser.
